# RSA-Encryption-Lab

The RSA encryption algorithm is one of the most used asymmetric cryptographic algorithms. It uses two extremely large prime numbers to generate public and private keys which 
can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, generate digital signatures, and verify digital signatures.

This is a simple lab demonstrating the procedure and uses of the RSA algorithm in C using the openssl library.
